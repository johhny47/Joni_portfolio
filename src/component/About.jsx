            Hi, I’m Joni Fakir, a passionate web developer with a focus on React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. I started my programming journey a year ago and love working on projects that solve real-world problems and make a meaningful impact. Always eager to learn, I thrive on building web applications and optimizing systems. Outside of coding, I’m an avid cricket and football fan, and enjoy running to recharge. I value collaboration, approach projects with a positive attitude, and am dedicated to delivering great results. If you’re looking for a driven developer, let’s connect!
