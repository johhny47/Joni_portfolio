              Hello, I'm Joni Fakir. I'm a developer  experience with dynamic, user-centric websites and applications. I have a strong proficiency in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React frameworks. On the back-end, I work with Node.js, Expressjs and MongoDB as databases.
              I am passionate about clean code, responsive design, and optimizing web performance. My expertise also extends to version control (Git), APIs, and ensuring that I deliver high-quality projects on time and within budget.
